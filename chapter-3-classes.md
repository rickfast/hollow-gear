## Chapter 3: Classes & Archetypes

### Overview

Every adventurer in Hollowgear embodies a unique relationship between instinct and invention.  
Classes define not just what a character does, but **how they reshape the world** — through tools, faith, fury, or thought.

Below are the six core classes of the Hollowgear system, plus the psionic **Mindweaver**, whose mastery of Aether defines the next age.

---

### ⚗️ Arcanist

**Role:** Scholar, manipulator of Aether, experimental technomage.  
**Core Stat:** Intelligence  
**Hit Die:** 1d6  
**Primary Resource:** Spell slots (Aether-powered magic)

---

#### _The Aetherwrights of Hollowgear_

Arcanists are the thinkers and dreamers who see the Aether as both art and science. They record the laws of psionics, but also break them — crafting machines that blur the line between spell and mechanism.

Arcanists study **“Threads”**, blending the elegance of arcane formulae with the precision of engineering.  
They can attach **Steam Mods** to their spell foci and build **Arcane Engines** that channel Aether directly.

---
