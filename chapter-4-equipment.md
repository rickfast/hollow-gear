### ⚙️ The Currency of the Hollowgear

The Hollowgear economy runs on **Aether-backed currency** — coins that resonate with faint psychic energy, forged from the same alloys that power machines.

| Currency | Symbol | Value               | Description                                         |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cog**  | ⚙️     | 1                   | Common brass coin; base trade unit.                 |
| **Gear** | ⚙️⚙️   | 10 Cogs             | Forged coin used by artisans.                       |
| **Core** | 🔷     | 100 Cogs / 10 Gears | Crystallized Aether shard used in high-value trade. |

-   **Aether Dust** is a gray-blue powder refined from psionic residue. It is worth roughly **25 Cogs per vial**.
-   Most adventurers begin with **2d6 × 10 Cogs** or equivalent equipment.

### 🛠️ Craftsmanship & Weapon Tiers

Weapons and armor are classified by craftsmanship tier rather than rarity.

| Tier | Name               | Modifier | Description                               |
| ---- | ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| I    | **Workshop Grade** | —        | Common gear built in guild forges.        |
| II   | **Guild Grade**    | +1       | Balanced and durable; often mod-ready.    |
| III  | **Relic Grade**    | +2       | Forged with psionic alloys and precision. |
| IV   | **Mythic Grade**   | +3       | Sentient relics or pre-collapse wonders.  |

Crafting higher tiers requires rare materials and **25 × tier² Cogs** in parts.

## 🛡️ Armor & Shields

Armor in Hollowgear protects as much against feedback and heat as against blades.  
Some sets incorporate steam vents, powered joints, or psionic resonators.

### ⚙️ Armor Maintenance & Overheat

-   **Armor Stress:** Each hour of combat or travel in powered armor requires a **DC 10 Con save**; on failure, gain one level of **Heat Stress**.
-   **Heat Stress (1–3):** −1 Dex and −5 ft Speed per level. Long rest or Steam Vent Harness clears all.
-   **Repairing Armor:** Requires Tinker’s Tools and 1d4 hours. Repairs restore 10 + INT modifier HP to armor structure.
