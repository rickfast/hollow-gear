    overview:
        "Hollowgear is a steampunk-fantasy world of anthropomorphic species, psionic resonance, and clockwork technology. The art should appear hand-drawn with chaotic, expressive lines and watercolor fills. The art style should be playful and chaotic. Colors should softly bleed outside the lines, as if painted on textured paper. Lighting is natural and diffused, with subtle warmth — imagine brass, parchment, and oil-lamp tones accented by cool aetheric glow. Avoid smooth digital gradients; favor watercolor irregularities, pooled pigments, and ink shadows. The world feels tactile, slightly grimy, yet filled with wonder — machinery hums like living creatures and psionic energy glows like stained glass light.",
    species: {
        Rendai: "Red panda-like artisans and engineers. Warm reddish or russet fur, masked faces, and bright eyes. Clothing includes aprons, belts, and heavy gloves; coats spattered with oil or soot. They often carry scrolls, blueprints, or small drones. Personality: warm, clever, industrious. Backgrounds can feature warm workshop light or the glow of forge fires.",
        Vulmir: "Foxfolk innovators and risk-takers. Slim, agile, and expressive, with orange, rust, or smoke-gray fur. Wear patchwork steampunk coats and multi-lens goggles. Always cluttered with gadgets, dangling tools, or prototype parts. Expression quick, eyes bright. Lines can be more scribbled and kinetic to suggest energy and movement.",
        Tharn: "Elk or stag-like warriors and guardians. Tall, strong, and grounded, with large antlers and calm eyes. Wear reinforced leather, brass plates, or draped tabards embossed with symbols of unity. Their fur is in tan, brown, or pale gray hues. The vibe is serene power — a living fortress in motion. Light plays softly on antlers and armor.",
        Karnathi:
            "Ibex-like templars and resonant knights. Spiraled horns, proud stance, solemn faces. Armor of polished brass and silver, adorned with glowing sigils and cloaks of deep blue or crimson. Their horns often bear engraved symbols of faith. They radiate balance, inner light, and psionic strength. Background can carry golden halo light or faint harmonic auras.",
        Skellin:
            "Gecko or lizard-like infiltrators and rogues. Smooth scales in earthy or subtle tones — moss green, sand, slate gray. Large reflective eyes and slender build. Clothing is lightweight, layered with wraps, belts, and goggles. Design favors asymmetry and negative space. Expressions subtle, poised, and calculating. Backgrounds dimly lit or with cool-toned reflections.",
        Aqualoth:
            "Axolotl-like psionics and mystics. Soft pastel hues — pink, violet, or pale blue. Translucent gills glow faintly with internal light. They wear fluid, robe-like garments that shimmer as if underwater. The overall look should feel ethereal, peaceful, and fluid. Background lighting soft and aquatic, with watercolor gradients blending like water ripples.",
        Avenar: "Avian scholars and arcanists. Feathers in silver, blue, or ivory tones, sometimes iridescent. Clothing formal and geometric, decorated with filigree and brass fittings. They stand tall and graceful, eyes sharp and reflective. Feathers near the head may flare when they channel Aether. Backgrounds should feel airy or sunlit, with soft motion in feathers.",
    },
    classes: {
        Artifex:
            "Inventors who animate machinery and wield tools like extensions of their minds. Outfit: leather harnesses, belts, tool satchels, and gloves stained with soot. Brass goggles and glowing aether tubing along the arms. Surrounded by small drones, tools, and sparks of creative chaos. Expression focused but warm, hair or fur slightly disheveled.",
        Arcanist:
            "Scholars of psionic formulae and engineered magic. Outfit: long coats or robes threaded with luminous circuitry. They wield gauntlets or lenses that channel equations into light. Their eyes shimmer faintly with internal radiance. Background should include ambient blue light or floating runic symbols.",
        Templar:
            "Resonant warriors who channel emotion into harmonic power. They wear heavy armor inscribed with glowing runes. Weapons vibrate with faint energy or sing when moved. Their poses are grounded and noble. Background light is golden and radiant, suggesting holiness expressed through resonance rather than religion.",
        Tweaker:
            "Mechanically enhanced brawlers. Bare-armed, with injectors, tubing, or piston augmentations visible on their bodies. Outfits are scavenged: belts, patchwork leather, sleeveless coats. Expressions fierce and exhilarated. Their surroundings crackle with kinetic energy — sparks, steam, or motion blur. Lighting warm and high contrast.",
        Shadehand:
            "Stealth specialists. Outfits dark and close-fitting, combining stealth armor, belts, and minimal ornamentation. Faces partially covered by goggles or wraps. Lines crisp and shadows deep. Backgrounds murky with faint luminescent edges — the sense of a silent movement caught mid-frame.",
        Vanguard:
            "Defenders and protectors. Heavy armor of brass and steel, embellished with geometric engravings. They hold shields or polearms at rest, embodying calm readiness. Their poses broad and centered. Lighting should emphasize their size and presence, using warm diffuse tones and subtle ambient glow.",
        Mindweaver:
            "Psionic adepts who manipulate thought itself. Robes or layered garments of thin, flowing material. Crystals or Aetheric halos orbit their head or hands. They emanate calm, composure, and quiet intensity. Backgrounds abstract — waves, fractal light, or circular geometry suggesting mental resonance.",
    },
    lightingAndComposition: {
        portrait:
            "Bust or upper-torso framing, centered, with natural diffused light. Focus on facial features and small clothing details. Watercolor bleed around the edges. Background simple — off-white, parchment, or faint wash of thematic color (blue for psionic, gold for faith, rust for industrial).",
        fullBody:
            "Dynamic stance showing full silhouette. Include tools, weapons, or gear elements appropriate to class. The linework slightly rougher at feet and background to emphasize watercolor looseness. Soft vignette fade at edges, as if sketched into a notebook or guild logbook.",
        scene: "Wide composition depicting the subject in an environmental context — workshop, forge, temple, laboratory, or battlefield. Lighting directional but soft, with visible brushstrokes defining smoke, steam, or Aether light. Keep background less detailed than character, using watercolor washes and suggestive outlines.",
