## Chapter 10: Languages & Scripts

> _"Every word in the Hollowgear carries weight — for even speech is a form of machinery."_

### ⚙️ Overview

Languages in **Hollowgear** are more than words — they are **interfaces** between thought and
reality.  
Each tongue evolved from a fusion of **biological memory**, **psionic resonance**, and **mechanical
necessity**.  
Spoken language carries vibration and emotion; written language encodes logic and geometry.

Adventurers will encounter many dialects across the world, some half-living, others purely
conceptual.

### 🔮 Psionic Communication

**Aetheric** is the only language that exists _entirely within thought_.  
Two creatures that share a psionic bond or Aetheric training can communicate complex ideas,
emotions, and sensory data without sound.

- Aetheric communication ignores barriers and language limitations.
- It can transmit only truth as the speaker perceives it — lies appear as distortions.
- A creature without Aetheric training that receives such thoughts experiences fragmented images and
  static.

**Mindweavers** and certain races (Avenar, Karnathi) can innately sense Aetheric resonance in nearby
communication.

The languages of Hollowgear often mutate as technology evolves.  
Regional scripts and slang may use **machine code**, **etched sigils**, or **steam-pulse signals**.

| Dialect         | Origin              | Distinction                                                       |

### 🧠 Learning New Languages

Characters can learn a new language through downtime or training.

| Method                    | Time    | Cost          | Requirement                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tutored Learning**      | 10 days | 25 Cogs       | Access to fluent speaker or lexicon.                                            |
| **Immersive Study**       | 30 days | —             | Must live among native speakers.                                                |
| **Psionic Imprint**       | 1 hour  | 1 Aether Dust | Learn a language instantly from a willing psionic creature (temporary: 7 days). |
| **Aether Crystal Memory** | 1 day   | 100 Cogs      | Absorb linguistic data from an artifact (permanent).                            |

Failure to maintain usage for a month may result in linguistic decay; roll DC 10 Int save to retain
fluency.

### 🎵 Roleplaying Languages

Encourage players to reflect their character’s origins and beliefs through language.

- An **Avenar** might whistle short melodic notes between sentences.
- A **Karnathi Templar** recites High Brass phrases during combat.
- A **Rendai** engineer names every tool affectionately — and argues with it when it breaks.

A character fluent in **multiple languages** can combine them creatively for coded speech, academic
debate, or psionic resonance tests.
