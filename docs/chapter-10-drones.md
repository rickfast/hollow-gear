### ⚙️ The Soul of the Machine

Where others see tools, the **Artifex** sees potential.  
Through precise calibration, Aether circuitry, and psionic imprinting, the Rendai Artifex can awaken small constructs known as **Drones** — semi-sentient mechanical partners that mirror their creator’s mind.

Drones are not merely machines. They are **extensions of the Artifex’s will**, given shape through aetheric resonance and guided emotion.  
Each develops quirks, preferences, and subtle personalities over time.

### 🧩 Drone Basics

Every Artifex begins with one basic drone.  
You can construct or reconstruct your drone during a **long rest** if you have **Tinker’s Tools** and 25 ⚙️ worth of components.

| Drone Type        | Size  | AC  | HP         | Speed            | Attack        | Damage        | Notes                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----- | --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Utility Drone** | Tiny  | 13  | 8 (2d6+1)  | 30 ft, fly 10 ft | Arc Cutter +3 | 1d4 slashing  | Carries 10 lb; assists with repairs.                              |
| **Combat Drone**  | Small | 15  | 12 (3d6+3) | 30 ft            | Shock Prod +4 | 1d6 lightning | Can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on one melee attack. |
| **Recon Drone**   | Tiny  | 12  | 7 (2d4+2)  | 20 ft, fly 30 ft | —             | —             | Darkvision 60 ft; transmits vision and sound to the Artifex.      |

You may have **only one active drone** at a time.  
If destroyed, it can be rebuilt at no XP cost using salvaged materials and 8 hours of work.

### ⚡ Drone Command

You command your drone mentally as a **Bonus Action**.  
It acts immediately after your turn. If not commanded, it defends itself but takes no proactive actions.

**Range:** 100 ft  
**Link Type:** Aetheric signal  
**Interference:** Thick walls or psionic fields may block commands; roll **INT save DC 10** per round to maintain control in such conditions.

---

### 🔧 Drone Modifications

Every drone includes **1 Mod Slot**, plus one additional slot at Artifex levels 5, 9, and 13.  
Mods are small devices that expand a drone’s functions — the same modular crafting system described in Chapter 5 applies here.

| Mod Name             | Tier | Effect                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aether Lens**      | I    | Drone can emit light in a 20 ft radius.                                |
| **Maglock Talons**   | I    | Drone can cling to walls or ceilings.                                  |
| **Shock Capacitor**  | II   | Once per short rest, drone’s attack deals +1d8 lightning damage.       |
| **Pressure Vent**    | II   | Drone vents steam, creating 5 ft obscurement (1/short rest).           |
| **Adaptive Armor**   | III  | Drone gains +1 AC; immune to nonmagical fire.                          |
| **Cognition Core**   | III  | Drone can make skill checks using your INT modifier.                   |
| **Soul Resonator**   | IV   | Drone gains limited empathy; advantage on Insight and Perception.      |
| **Arc Pulse Cannon** | IV   | Drone can fire a 15 ft line of energy (Dex save DC 13, 2d8 lightning). |

### 🧠 Drone Intelligence

Each drone has a personality “seed” based on its construction method. Roll or choose below.

| d6  | Personality Quirk                                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Obsessively catalogs all mechanical sounds.           |
| 2   | Defends its maker’s reputation with chirps or lights. |
| 3   | Mimics the voice of its creator imperfectly.          |
| 4   | Collects small shiny objects or screws.               |
| 5   | Displays jealousy when ignored for too long.          |
| 6   | Emits low mechanical purring when praised.            |

Drones cannot speak, but they **communicate via chirps, blinks, or light patterns**.  
At higher levels, some Artifex integrate a **Psionic Uplink**, allowing true mental conversation.

### 🛠️ Drone Crafting Rules

**To Build a Drone:**

- Requires **Tinker’s Tools proficiency**.
- Takes **8 hours** of focused work.
- Requires materials equal to 25 ⚙️ × Tier (I–IV).
- On a failed **DC 14 Tinkering check**, components fuse incorrectly — repair takes 2 hours and 5 ⚙️ in parts.

**Repairing a Drone:**

- As an **Action**, you can spend 1 ⚙️ and repair 1d6 HP.
- Overclocking a repair (spending 3 ⚙️) repairs 3d6 HP but gives the drone 1 Heat point.

### 🔥 Drone Heat & Overload

Drones, like their masters, generate **Heat** during combat or overuse.

| Source                            | Heat Gain       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Each attack or ability use        | +1              |
| Overclocked action                | +2              |
| Sustained flight or heavy lifting | +1 per 2 rounds |

At **5+ Heat**, roll a **Malfunction Check (d6)**:

| d6  | Malfunction                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Shuts down for 1 round.                             |
| 2   | Discharges static (5 ft radius, 1d4 lightning dmg). |
| 3   | Vocal loop (emits random noise, reveals position).  |
| 4   | Reverses targeting; attacks ally until reset.       |
| 5   | Random movement 10 ft in random direction.          |
| 6   | No effect; cooling successful.                      |

### 🧩 Drone Evolution

Drones level alongside their creator.  
When the Artifex reaches Levels 5, 9, and 13, the drone gains an **upgrade**:

| Level | Upgrade                                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | +1 AC, +5 HP, +1 Mod Slot                                                                       |
| 9     | Gain one **Active Feature** (e.g., flight, climb, swim, darkvision 60 ft)                       |
| 13    | Drone gains **limited self-direction** — acts independently for up to 3 rounds without command. |

### ⚙️ Drone Personalization

Artifex are known for customizing their drones to match personal flair.  
These visual and tonal alterations have no mechanical effect, but deepen immersion:

- **Shell Finish:** Verdigris brass, black enamel, or mindglass lacquer.
- **Core Color:** Blue (psionic), green (mechanical), red (volatile).
- **Behavioral Quirk:** Chooses its own perch, favorite gear, or ritual chirp.

> They are children of intention — curious, fallible, and brave.”_

### 🧰 Game Hooks & Integration

- **Lost Drone:** A damaged prototype roams the wastes, broadcasting its creator’s voice.
- **Hive-Network:** Multiple drones synchronize into a single gestalt intelligence.
- **Corrupted Drone:** A Mindweaver’s psionic echo infects a mechanical unit.
- **Artifact Drone:** A pre-Collapse construct with its own evolving consciousness seeks a new pilot.
