### ⚗️ Arcanist Formulae

Arcanists reshape Aether through equation and artifice. Each formula is a hybrid of magic, engineering, and intuition — a **mathematical miracle** driven by will and machinery.

---

#### **Level 1 Formulae**

**Arc Pulse Array** _(Magic Missile)_  
_1 AFP – Action – Range 120 ft_  
You release three bolts of condensed plasma, each striking a target for **1d4 + 1 force damage**.  
The bolts automatically hit, appearing as glowing blue-white threads of Aether.  
At higher levels: +1 bolt per spell level above 1.

---

**Deflection Field** _(Shield)_  
_1 AFP – Reaction (when hit by an attack)_  
An electromagnetic barrier flares into being, adding **+5 AC** until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack.  
Visible as a flickering lattice of hexagonal light.

---

**Arcane Vent** _(Burning Hands)_  
_1 AFP – Action – 15 ft cone_  
You open a pressure valve in your gauntlet or staff, releasing flame and vapor.  
Creatures in the area make a **Dex save (DC = 8 + proficiency + INT)** or take **3d6 fire damage**, half on success.

---

**Blink Discharge** _(Misty Step)_  
_2 AFP – Bonus Action – 30 ft range_  
You briefly convert yourself into raw Aether and re-materialize elsewhere in a blink of static and light.  
You leave behind a faint harmonic echo audible to psionically aware creatures.

---

#### **Level 2 Formulae**

**Logic Override** _(Counterspell)_  
_2 AFP – Reaction_  
Interrupt the casting of another spell within 60 ft by introducing conflicting psionic frequencies.  
If the spell is 2nd level or lower, it fails. For higher levels, roll **INT + proficiency** vs **DC 10 + spell level**.

---

**Thermoflux Lance** _(Scorching Ray)_  
_2 AFP – Action – Range 120 ft_  
Create three streaks of molten Aether energy. Each ray deals **2d6 fire damage** on a hit.  
At higher levels: +1 ray per spell level above 2.

---

**Aetheric Tether** _(Hold Person)_  
_2 AFP – Action – Range 60 ft – Concentration, 1 min_  
You bind a humanoid target in telekinetic threads.  
Target must succeed on a **Wis save** or be paralyzed until the end of your next turn.  
Each round, they may repeat the save at the end of their turn.

---

#### **Level 3 Formulae**

**Thermoflux Core Ignition** _(Fireball)_  
_3 AFP – Action – 20 ft radius – Range 150 ft_  
You hurl a charged Aether core that detonates into vaporized plasma.  
Each creature in the area must make a **Dex save** or take **8d6 fire damage** (half on success).  
All metal surfaces in the area glow red-hot for 1 round.

---

**Pulse Disruptor** _(Dispel Magic)_  
_3 AFP – Action – 120 ft_  
Stabilize local psionic fields, ending a spell or effect of level ≤ your INT modifier + proficiency.  
For higher-level effects, roll **INT + proficiency** vs **DC 10 + spell level**.

---

**Resonant Barrier** _(Leomund’s Tiny Hut)_  
_3 AFP – Ritual – 1 minute cast time_  
A 10-ft-radius shimmering dome forms around you and up to 8 creatures.  
The barrier equalizes pressure and heat, providing total cover and shelter for 8 hours.  
It hums softly in tune with your heartbeat.

### 🛡️ Templar Miracles

Templars channel the same Aether through emotion and conviction rather than logic.  
Each Miracle is a **resonance of faith**, conducted through living flesh instead of steel.

---

### ⚖️ Playtest Guidelines

**Balance Reference:**

-   **AFP and RC costs** match spell levels directly for parity.
-   **Heat or Feedback** provides a mild drawback (~5–10% resource tax).
-   Each caster’s power ceiling mirrors 5E progression while keeping Hollowgear’s identity of _tension, consequence, and invention._

**Testing Goals:**

1. Track how often players reach Overheat or Faith Feedback thresholds.
2. Observe pacing of AFP/RC recovery in dungeon-style vs. narrative encounters.
3. Test whether cooperative channeling (Arcanist + Templar) feels powerful but risky.
4. Identify 2–3 “signature” Formulae or Miracles that define each playstyle.
