### ⚗️ Arcanist Formulae

Arcanists reshape Aether through equation and artifice. Each formula is a hybrid of magic,
engineering, and intuition — a **mathematical miracle** driven by will and machinery.

### 🛡️ Templar Miracles

Templars channel the same Aether through emotion and conviction rather than logic.  
Each Miracle is a **resonance of faith**, conducted through living flesh instead of steel.

### ⚙️ Spellcasting Overview
In Hollowgear, spell effects manifest as **Aetheric Resonance** — psionic intention shaped through engineered conductors.  
Each ability belongs to one of two traditions:

- **Formulae (Arcanist)** — scientific manipulation of Aether through lenses, circuits, and modular foci.  
- **Miracles (Templar)** — harmonic resonance conducted through conviction, faith, or emotional focus.

### ⚖️ Playtest Guidelines

**Balance Reference:**

- **AFP and RC costs** match spell levels directly for parity.
- **Heat or Feedback** provides a mild drawback (~5–10% resource tax).
- Each caster’s power ceiling mirrors 5E progression while keeping Hollowgear’s identity of
  _tension, consequence, and invention._

**Testing Goals:**

1. Track how often players reach Overheat or Faith Feedback thresholds.
2. Observe pacing of AFP/RC recovery in dungeon-style vs. narrative encounters.
3. Test whether cooperative channeling (Arcanist + Templar) feels powerful but risky.
4. Identify 2–3 “signature” Formulae or Miracles that define each playstyle.
