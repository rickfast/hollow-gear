## Chapter 6: Psionics & the Mindcraft System

### 🧠 What is Mindcraft?

Mindcraft is the art of shaping the Aether — the invisible medium that bridges will and world.  
Where spellcasters manipulate external forces through ritual and formula, psionics draw from
**within**, channeling thought, emotion, and intent directly into action.

Mindcraft users (called **Weavers**) reshape space, time, and perception not with words or tools,
but by **tuning their consciousness** to the resonant frequency of reality itself.

### ⚙️ Core Concepts

| Term                         | Definition                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aether Flux Points (AFP)** | The energy used to manifest psionic powers. Restored on short or long rest. |
| **Disciplines**              | Categories of psionic focus (e.g. Flux, Echo, Eidolon).                     |
| **Powers**                   | Individual abilities learned from Disciplines.                              |
| **Focus Limit**              | Number of psionic effects you can sustain simultaneously.                   |
| **Psionic Surge**            | Channel extra energy to amplify powers beyond safe output.                  |
| **Overload**                 | The cost of pushing your mind too far — risk of backlash.                   |

### 🔮 Aether Flux Points (AFP)

**AFP = Class Level + Ability Modifier** (minimum 2).  
Mindweavers and hybrids replenish AFP after a **short or long rest**.

| Power Tier | AFP Cost | Typical Power Level                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1     | 1        | Simple (cantrip-equivalent)              |
| Tier 2     | 2        | Low-level psionic techniques             |
| Tier 3     | 3        | Moderate spatial or psychic manipulation |
| Tier 4     | 4        | Advanced telekinetic or empathic powers  |
| Tier 5     | 5+       | Reality-bending manifestations           |

When your AFP reach 0, you gain **1 level of Fatigue** until you complete a long rest.

### 🧩 Disciplines of the Mind

Each Mindcrafter develops resonance in one or more Disciplines.  
Disciplines define both theme and mechanics, and can be expanded via class features or training.

---

### 🌀 Power Scaling

You can **amplify** a psionic power by spending additional AFP up to double its base cost.  
Each additional AFP increases:

- **Damage:** +1 die per AFP.
- **Range/Duration:** +50%.
- **Save DC:** +1 per 2 AFP (rounded down).

---

### ⚠️ Overload & Feedback

When you use more AFP than your level allows (e.g. expending 6 AFP at Level 3), make a **DC 12 +
excess AFP** **Constitution save**.  
On failure, roll **Psionic Feedback (d6):**

| d6  | Feedback Effect                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Minor headache – disadvantage on next roll.                 |
| 2   | Static echo – random nearby device malfunctions.            |
| 3   | Neural spark – take 1d6 psychic damage.                     |
| 4   | Aether flare – emit 10-ft light, all in area take 1d4 fire. |
| 5   | Mindfracture – lose concentration, drop active powers.      |
| 6   | Collapse – stunned until end of next turn.                  |

---

### 🧬 Psionic Focus

You may **maintain a psionic focus** on one power with a sustained duration (like concentration).  
Your **Focus Limit** begins at 1 and increases at:

- Level 6 → 2
- Level 10 → 3

While maintaining focus, you cannot manifest another sustained power without releasing one.  
If your Focus is broken, make a **DC 10 Constitution save** or take 1d4 psychic backlash.

### 🕯️ Learning Powers

| Method                    | Requirement                         | Result                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Meditation**            | 8 hours downtime + 50 ⚙️            | Learn 1 Tier 1 power.                           |
| **Mentorship**            | Find psionic mentor, 7 days study   | Learn power of Tier ≤ your Level ÷ 2.           |
| **Aether Crystal**        | Absorb knowledge from psionic relic | Instantly learn embedded power (risk feedback). |
| **Mindforge Integration** | Embed power into weapon or armor    | Use that power 1/day as item ability.           |

Mindweavers and Aethermancers automatically gain 1 new power per level.

---

### 🌀 Psionic Surge

Once per short rest, you may overexert your mind to temporarily boost output.  
For one turn:

- Add +2 to attack rolls and save DCs for psionic powers.
- You may ignore AFP cost for one Tier 1–2 power.  
  Afterward, take 1d4 psychic damage and cannot regain AFP until end of next short rest.

### 🕳️ Optional Rule: Psionic Signatures

Every Mindcrafter’s energy leaves a unique **psychic fingerprint** — visible as rippling light,
faint sound, or emotional aura.

| Emotion   | Manifestation                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Rage      | Red flickers of heat and vibration.          |
| Calm      | Cool, blue-hued resonance.                   |
| Curiosity | Rapid, flickering pulses and metallic chime. |
| Despair   | Distorted echo and faint afterimage.         |

Creatures with the _Aether Sensitivity_ trait can detect these signatures within 30 ft.

### 📖 Example Psionic Combos

| Combo                                | Effect                                                           |

| **Kinetic Barrier + Resonant Pulse** | Form defensive wall, then shatter it outward in sonic shockwave. |

---

### 🧩 Psionic Crafting (Optional)

A psionic user may inscribe their powers into **Aether Relics** — mental imprints within crystals or
armor.  
Each relic can store **1 Tier 1–3 power** and requires:

- 1 Aether Crystal (worth 100 ⚙️)
- 1 hour of meditation
- DC 15 Arcana or Insight check

Stored powers may be triggered by others with half the normal save DC and AFP cost.
