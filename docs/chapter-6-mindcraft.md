### üß† What is Mindcraft?

Mindcraft is the art of shaping the Aether ‚Äî the invisible medium that bridges will and world.  
Where spellcasters manipulate external forces through ritual and formula, psionics draw from
**within**, channeling thought, emotion, and intent directly into action.

Mindcraft users (called **Weavers**) reshape space, time, and perception not with words or tools,
but by **tuning their consciousness** to the resonant frequency of reality itself.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

| Term                         | Definition                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aether Flux Points (AFP)** | The energy used to manifest psionic powers. Restored on short or long rest. |
| **Disciplines**              | Categories of psionic focus (e.g. Flux, Echo, Eidolon).                     |
| **Powers**                   | Individual abilities learned from Disciplines.                              |
| **Focus Limit**              | Number of psionic effects you can sustain simultaneously.                   |
| **Psionic Surge**            | Channel extra energy to amplify powers beyond safe output.                  |
| **Overload**                 | The cost of pushing your mind too far ‚Äî risk of backlash.                   |

---

### üîÆ Aether Flux Points (AFP)

**AFP = Class Level + Ability Modifier** (minimum 2).  
Mindweavers and hybrids replenish AFP after a **short or long rest**.

| Power Tier | AFP Cost | Typical Power Level                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1     | 1        | Simple (cantrip-equivalent)              |
| Tier 2     | 2        | Low-level psionic techniques             |
| Tier 3     | 3        | Moderate spatial or psychic manipulation |
| Tier 4     | 4        | Advanced telekinetic or empathic powers  |
| Tier 5     | 5+       | Reality-bending manifestations           |

When your AFP reach 0, you gain **1 level of Fatigue** until you complete a long rest.

### üåÄ Power Scaling

You can **amplify** a psionic power by spending additional AFP up to double its base cost.  
Each additional AFP increases:

- **Damage:** +1 die per AFP.
- **Range/Duration:** +50%.
- **Save DC:** +1 per 2 AFP (rounded down).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Overload & Feedback

When you use more AFP than your level allows (e.g. expending 6 AFP at Level 3), make a **DC 12 +
excess AFP** **Constitution save**.  
On failure, roll **Psionic Feedback (d6):**

| d6  | Feedback Effect                                             |

| 4   | Aether flare ‚Äì emit 10-ft light, all in area take 1d4 fire. |

| 6   | Collapse ‚Äì stunned until end of next turn.                  |

---

### üß¨ Psionic Focus

You may **maintain a psionic focus** on one power with a sustained duration (like concentration).  
Your **Focus Limit** begins at 1 and increases at:

- Level 6 ‚Üí 2
- Level 10 ‚Üí 3

While maintaining focus, you cannot manifest another sustained power without releasing one.  
If your Focus is broken, make a **DC 10 Constitution save** or take 1d4 psychic backlash.

### üåÄ Psionic Surge

Once per short rest, you may overexert your mind to temporarily boost output.  
For one turn:

- Add +2 to attack rolls and save DCs for psionic powers.
- You may ignore AFP cost for one Tier 1‚Äì2 power.  
  Afterward, take 1d4 psychic damage and cannot regain AFP until end of next short rest.

### üï≥Ô∏è Optional Rule: Psionic Signatures

Every Mindcrafter‚Äôs energy leaves a unique **psychic fingerprint** ‚Äî visible as rippling light,
