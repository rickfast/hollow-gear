## Chapter 14: Managing Heat

### ⚙️ The Principle of Heat

In Hollowgear, **Heat** represents the friction between will and machinery — the literal and metaphysical byproduct of overexertion, stress, or unstable Aether.  
Where _hit points_ measure bodily endurance, **Heat** measures **system strain**: mental focus, mechanical pressure, and psionic instability.

Heat accumulates from combat, overclocking, psionic feedback, or harsh environments.  
If left unmanaged, it leads to **malfunctions, burnout, and critical overloads** — but clever characters can harness it for controlled bursts of power.

---

### 🔥 Tracking Heat

Each character, construct, or device with mechanical or psionic systems tracks **Heat Points (HPt)** separately from HP.

#### **Heat Meter**

- Default Maximum: **10 HPt**
- Safe Operating Range: **0–5 HPt**
- Danger Zone: **6–9 HPt**
- Overheat Threshold: **10+ HPt**

Once Heat exceeds your safe range, your systems begin to **strain**.  
When you reach **10 Heat**, you must make an **Overheat Check** or suffer mechanical and mental consequences (see below).

> **Tip for GMs:**  
> Use a red or brass dial on your character sheet or digital UI to visually track Heat buildup.  
> Encourage the table to narrate the rising tension: glowing vents, strained breathing, flickering lights, etc.

### ⚡ Sources of Heat

| Action or Condition                         | Heat Gained     | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| Overclocking a mod or spell                 | +2              | See Chapter 5 & 11.                   |

### 🧩 Overheat Checks

When your Heat exceeds 10 HPt, roll a **Constitution saving throw** (for living beings) or **Tinkering check** (for constructs or armor systems).

**DC = 10 + (Heat Points above 10)**

| Result      | Outcome                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Success** | The system stabilizes; reduce Heat by 2 and continue operating. |
| **Failure** | Roll on the **Overheat Table** below.                           |

### ⚠️ Overheat Table

| d8  | Overheat Result                                                                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Steam Leak:** Take 1d6 fire damage; lose 1 AC until repaired.                                      |
| 2   | **Circuit Burn:** Lose next Bonus Action.                                                            |
| 3   | **Overpressure:** Weapon or armor jammed until end of next turn.                                     |
| 4   | **Psionic Distortion:** Take 1d4 psychic damage; disadvantage on next Concentration check.           |
| 5   | **Core Rupture:** 10-ft explosion; creatures nearby take 2d6 fire damage (Dex save DC 12 for half).  |
| 6   | **Feedback Loop:** Spell or mod repeats randomly on next target.                                     |
| 7   | **System Shutdown:** You lose your next Action as cooling kicks in.                                  |
| 8   | **Controlled Surge:** Power briefly stabilizes — your next roll has advantage, but you gain +2 Heat. |

### 🧊 Cooling Down

You can reduce accumulated Heat through downtime, tools, or abilities.

| Method                          | Heat Reduced | Time    | Requirements                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vent Steam** (Action)         | −2           | 1 round | Available to powered gear users; creates 5-ft steam cloud.    |
| **Coolant Flask**               | −1d4         | Action  | Consumes item (see Chapter 9).                                |
| **Repair Paste or Maintenance** | −1d4         | 10 min  | Requires Tinker’s Tools.                                      |
| **Short Rest**                  | −1d6         | 1 hr    | Natural recovery.                                             |
| **Long Rest**                   | Reset to 0   | 8 hr    | Full cooldown and system purge.                               |
| **Environmental Cooling**       | Variable     | —       | Standing in water, shadow, or snow may slow Heat gain by 50%. |

### 🧠 Heat & Psionics

Mindweavers, Arcanists, and Templars generate Heat through **Aether resonance**.  
Unlike mechanical overheat, psionic buildup manifests as headaches, static hallucinations, or short-term emotional overload.

At 10+ Heat:

- You may gain the **Disoriented** condition: disadvantage on INT/WIS checks until cooled.
- Psionic effects emit faint light or harmonic tones visible to those nearby.

If a psionic character and mechanical construct are linked (e.g., Mindweaver commanding a Drone), **both share Heat**.  
Split Heat evenly between them, rounding up.

### 🔩 Heat Stress Levels

Extended exposure causes long-term degradation — known as **Heat Stress**.

| Level | Effect                                                                        |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Disadvantage on Stealth and Perception (audible hissing, flickering lights).  |
| 2     | −1 Dexterity and Speed reduced by 5 ft.                                       |
| 3     | Disadvantage on all Attack Rolls until next Long Rest.                        |
| 4     | Exhaustion Level 1 and random malfunction each encounter.                     |
| 5     | System Collapse — armor, drone, or weapon permanently disabled until rebuilt. |

Heat Stress resets after a **full long rest in a cool environment**, or through **Steam Vent Harnesses** (see Chapter 9).

### ⚙️ Heat Threshold Traits

Characters or species might have **traits that modify Heat capacity**:

| Trait                      | Effect                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tempered Systems**       | Max Heat +2.                                                               |
| **Flux-Touched**           | Immune to first 2 Heat per short rest, but malfunction results roll twice. |
| **Organic Frame**          | Can convert 1 Heat into 1d4 self-damage to vent energy safely.             |
| **Cold-Blooded** (Skellin) | Double Heat gain in warm environments; half in cold ones.                  |

### 🧮 Example: Heat Tracking in Combat

**Velka the Tweaker** begins combat with a baseline of 0 Heat.

- Overclocks weapon: +2 Heat
- Uses Steam Mod twice: +2 Heat
- Takes fire damage: +1 Heat  
  → Total = 5 Heat (safe range).

Later, she Overclocks again and takes a lightning hit (+3 more total) → now at **8 Heat**, entering the danger zone.  
At 10, she must make a DC 10 + 0 = 10 **Overheat Check**.  
She fails, rolls a 5 on the table → **Core Rupture**, causing a 10-ft explosion before resetting Heat to 6.

### 🌡️ Environmental Heat Rules

In extreme environments, Heat becomes a passive hazard.

| Environment                       | Heat Gain Rate   | Example Effects                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forgeworks or Magma Fields**    | +1/minute        | Metal glows, steam hisses, mods fail more often. |
| **Desert or Furnace Wastes**      | +1/5 minutes     | Fatigue, dehydration, and armor discomfort.      |
| **Psionic Storms**                | +1/round exposed | Psychic static, spells distort or duplicate.     |
| **Underwater or Cryogenic Zones** | −1/round         | Natural coolant, but risk of frost stress.       |

### 🧠 GM Guidance: Using Heat Narratively

Heat is a _storytelling tool_, not just a stat:

- Use it to convey rising tension and mechanical exhaustion.
- Let NPCs or environments visually respond — flickering lights, steam leaks, heartbeat-like thrum of engines.
- Reward clever Heat management; penalize reckless Overclocking with cinematic failures.
- Allow _controlled venting_ to be dramatic — steam clouds, light bursts, screams of Aether energy.
