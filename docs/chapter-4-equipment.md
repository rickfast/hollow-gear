### ‚öôÔ∏è The Currency of the Hollowgear

The Hollowgear economy runs on **Aether-backed currency** ‚Äî coins that resonate with faint psychic energy, forged from the same alloys that power machines.

| Currency | Symbol | Value               | Description                                         |

| **Core** | üî∑     | 100 Cogs / 10 Gears | Crystallized Aether shard used in high-value trade. |

-   **Aether Dust** is a gray-blue powder refined from psionic residue. It is worth roughly **25 Cogs per vial**.
-   Most adventurers begin with **2d6 √ó 10 Cogs** or equivalent equipment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Craftsmanship & Weapon Tiers

Weapons and armor are classified by craftsmanship tier rather than rarity.

| Tier | Name               | Modifier | Description                               |

| IV   | **Mythic Grade**   | +3       | Sentient relics or pre-collapse wonders.  |

Crafting higher tiers requires rare materials and **25 √ó tier¬≤ Cogs** in parts.

-   **Heat Stress (1‚Äì3):** ‚àí1 Dex and ‚àí5 ft Speed per level. Long rest or Steam Vent Harness clears all.

### üß© Mod Blueprints

Mod Blueprints are schematics, half mental and half mechanical, that describe how to install and stabilize advanced gear modifications.  
Some are written on brass etchings, others burned into psionic glass or carried as psychic imprints.

---

#### **Blueprint Types**

| Type | Source | Examples |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Mechanical** | Guild-forged or reverse-engineered from found tech | Overclock Coil, Pressure Vent, Reinforced Plating |
| **Psionic** | Learned from Mindweavers or relics | Resonant Core, Flux Dampener, Soul Mirror |
| **Hybrid** | Fusion of machine and mind | Aether Amplifier, Magnetron Housing, Entropy Lattice |

---

#### **Blueprint Rarity**

| Tier | Learn DC | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|
| I ‚Äì Common | 10 | Easy to replicate from scavenged designs. |
| II ‚Äì Advanced | 13 | Requires Tinkering proficiency and lab access. |
| III ‚Äì Relic | 16 | Found in Aether Vaults; psionic encryption. |
| IV ‚Äì Prototype | 18 | Often incomplete or unstable. GM discretion. |

---

#### **Copying & Crafting**

To copy a blueprint:
- Requires **Tinker‚Äôs Tools** or **Calligrapher‚Äôs Supplies**, and **2 hours per tier**.
- Costs **10 √ó tier¬≤ Cogs** in materials.  
- On a failure by 5+, the resulting copy is flawed (roll Malfunction Table, Chapter 5).

To craft a mod from a blueprint:
- Requires knowing the **blueprint** and meeting **Craft DC** for that tier (see Chapter 5).  
- Consumes **Aether Dust** and **1 Aether Cell** during assembly.  
- Relic and Prototype mods may require **psionic focus** during crafting.

---

#### **Lost Blueprints**

Some blueprints exist only as mental echoes ‚Äî the crafter must reconstruct them from psionic resonance.  
A Mindweaver or Artifex can attempt to recreate a lost mod by meditating near the remains of one, spending **8 hours and 1 Aether Dust vial**, and succeeding on a **DC 16 Arcana** check.

### üíé Treasures & Trade Goods

### üß† Identification & Appraisal

Identifying an unknown item requires one of the following:
- **1 hour** of study with Tinker‚Äôs Tools or Arcana proficiency.  
- **Casting Detect Magic** or **using Aether Vision** (if available).  
- Spending **25 Cogs** for guild identification.  

Psionic items may reveal fragmentary memories or emotional residue during identification ‚Äî a glimpse of the creator‚Äôs mind.

---

### üìú Item Customization Rules

Players may modify, rename, or rebuild items with GM approval.  
When doing so:
- Costs **25% of the item‚Äôs value** in parts.  
- Requires **half a workday per tier**.  
- Allows players to re-skin, rename, or flavor the item without changing its mechanics.

Example:
> A ‚ÄúVoltaic Cloak‚Äù could become a ‚ÄúThunder-Twine Mantle,‚Äù powered by a bound storm elemental instead of coils ‚Äî mechanically identical, narratively distinct.

> *"To craft is to remember. To repair is to forgive."*  
> ‚Äî Avenar axiom, *The Song of Forms*
