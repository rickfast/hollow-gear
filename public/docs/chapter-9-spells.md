### ⚗️ Spellcraft in the Hollowgear

Spells in Hollowgear are neither divine nor arcane — they are **Aetheric harmonics**, patterns that
shape reality through resonance.  
An **Arcanist** manipulates these harmonics through _formulae_ and _machines_.  
A **Templar** conducts them through _faith_ and _emotion_.

Both paths draw from the same current — **Aether** — but interpret it through radically different
circuitry.

## ⚙️ Arcanist Spellcasting – “Aether Formulae”

> _"If you know the equation, you can rewrite the world."_  
> — Lyrra Quenchcoil

---

### 🔹 Aether Equilibrium

Arcanists don’t prepare spells. Instead, they learn **Formulae** — equations encoded in Aether.  
When casting, they balance output and heat using **Aether Flux Points (AFP)** instead of spell
slots.

| Spell Level | AFP Cost |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 1           | 1        |
| 2           | 2        |
| 3           | 3        |
| 4           | 4        |
| 5           | 5        |

You regain **half your total AFP** on a **short rest** and all AFP after a **long rest**.

Your **maximum castable spell level** (Equilibrium Tier) equals **Level ÷ 2 (rounded up)**.

---

### 🔹 Overclocking

Arcanists can push their equations past stability.

- **Spend +1 AFP** to gain +2 to spell attack rolls or save DCs for that casting.
- After casting, gain **1d2 Heat Points** (see Chapter 7).
- On a natural 1, roll on the **Overheat Table**.

**At Level 5+,** you may Overclock twice per long rest without risk, representing improved reactor
tuning.

---

### 🔹 Spell Reflavoring

Arcanists still use the **Wizard and Warlock spell lists**, but their presentation is mechanical or
psionic.

| Classic Spell   | Arcanist Name                | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Magic Missile_ | **Arc Pulse Array**          | Vents bolts of stabilized plasma.                       |
| _Shield_        | **Deflection Field**         | Generates magnetic barrier.                             |
| _Misty Step_    | **Blink Discharge**          | Instant displacement via teleport pulse.                |
| _Counterspell_  | **Logic Override**           | Cancels a spell by destabilizing its Aetheric equation. |
| _Fireball_      | **Thermoflux Core Ignition** | Unstable chain reaction in a 20-ft sphere.              |

Each Formula emits a distinctive **tone and color signature** unique to the Arcanist’s personality.

### 🔹 Subclass Interaction

| Archetype        | Feature                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aetherwright** | Recover +1 AFP when you deal critical damage with a Formula.           |
| **Gearwright**   | Embed one Formula into a device, allowing an ally to cast it once/day. |
| **Flux Adept**   | Overclock adds +1d8 damage but doubles Heat gain.                      |

---

### 🔹 Equipment as Focus

Arcanists channel spells through custom foci:

- **Steamstaff** – Stable control, grants +1 to spell attack rolls.
- **Aether Lens** – Increases range of Formulae by 10 ft.
- **Voltaic Gauntlet** – Adds +1d4 lightning to spell damage when Overclocked.

## 🛡️ Templar Spellcasting – “Resonant Miracles”

> _"Faith is the science of the soul."_  
> — Karn Voss, Brass Pilgrim

---

### 🔹 Resonance Charges (RC)

Templars do not memorize prayers — they **resonate** with divine frequency through psionic focus.  
Each spell consumes **Resonance Charges (RC)** rather than spell slots.

| Spell Level | RC Cost |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 1           | 1       |
| 2           | 2       |
| 3           | 3       |
| 4           | 4       |
| 5           | 5       |

Your total RC = **Templar Level + Wisdom modifier**.  
You regain all RC after a **long rest**, and **half RC** after a **short rest** through meditation
or recalibration of your core.

---

### 🔹 Overchannel (Faith Feedback)

When out of RC, you may still cast by burning vitality.

- Spend HP = 2 × spell level to cast.
- Roll a **Faith Feedback check (DC 10 + spell level)**.
    - **Success:** The spell stabilizes.
    - **Failure:** You gain one level of **Heat Stress** and disadvantage on concentration checks
      until rest.

Templars may safely Overchannel once per day without consequence.

---

### 🔹 Miracles and Harmonics

Templars use the **Cleric spell list**, reflavored through psionic resonance.

| Classic Spell      | Templar Version          | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| _Cure Wounds_      | **Pulse of Restoration** | Emits harmonic wave of healing light.      |
| _Bless_            | **Harmonic Field**       | Allies’ weapons hum with divine frequency. |
| _Spiritual Weapon_ | **Faith Construct**      | Manifested psionic shape of conviction.    |
| _Detect Magic_     | **Sense Resonance**      | Reveals active Aetheric signatures.        |
| _Sanctuary_        | **Echo Barrier**         | Creates reflective psionic field.          |

Each Order of Resonance (Templar archetype) colors its spells differently — glowing blue for order,
gold for zeal, violet for penitence, etc.

### 🔹 Subclass Interaction

| Order                  | Feature                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relic Knight**       | Channel Resonance through armor; add +1d4 radiant to melee attacks.             |
| **Iron Saint**         | Convert 25% of damage taken into HP restored to nearby allies.                  |
| **Voice of the Choir** | Gain telepathic link with allies within 60 ft; share resistance to psychic dmg. |

## 🧩 Shared Spellcraft Rules

### 🔸 Concentration

- Breaking focus releases built-up Aether: take 1d4 psychic damage.
- Each Heat Point above 5 imposes −1 to concentration saves.

### 🔸 Spell Mods

Certain devices may alter spellcasting, similar to weapon mods.

| Mod                   | Effect                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flux Capacitor**    | Reduce AFP/RC cost by 1 (min 1) once/short rest.           |
| **Aether Stabilizer** | Ignore first Heat Point per casting.                       |
| **Resonant Core**     | Increases spell save DC by +1.                             |
| **Dampener Coil**     | Spells deal −1 damage die but cannot trigger malfunctions. |

---

### 🔸 Heat and Harmony

Casting creates friction between mind and machine.

| Source                           | Heat Gain     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Overclock / Overchannel          | +2 Heat       |
| Maintaining two Concentrations   | +1 Heat/round |
| Failing a Feedback check         | +1d4 Heat     |
| Powered Focus (Steamstaff, etc.) | +1 Heat/spell |

Cooling occurs during short rest or through Steam Vents (see Chapter 7).

---

### 🔸 Cooperative Channeling

When an **Arcanist** and **Templar** cast the same spell together:

- Split the total AFP + RC cost evenly (rounded up).
- The spell doubles its **duration or area**, chosen by the casters.
- On a natural 1 by either caster, roll on **Overheat Table** and halve both resources.

Such moments are rare — and awe-inspiring.

---

### 🔸 Counter-Casting

When a creature attempts to interrupt your spell:

- Make an **Arcana (Arcanist)** or **Religion (Templar)** check against DC 10 + the opposing
  caster’s level.
- Success disrupts their formula or miracle before resolution.
- On a failure by 5+, take 1d6 psychic backlash as the resonance snaps.

---

### 🔸 Psionic Signatures

Every spell leaves a **resonant echo** in the Aether — a color, tone, or vibration unique to the
caster.  
Mindweavers, Avenar, and trained Templars can detect these traces with a DC 12 Insight or Arcana
check.  
Powerful echoes may linger for days, attracting Aether Wisps or Flux Aberrants.

## ⚖️ Balance Overview

| Aspect        | Arcanist                   | Templar                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Resource Type | AFP (short-rest focus)     | RC (long-rest focus)         |
| Core Risk     | Heat buildup / malfunction | Feedback / HP loss           |
| Role          | Burst caster, manipulator  | Support, sustain, protection |
| Flavor        | Science, invention         | Faith, resonance             |
| Refresh Loop  | Frequent (like Warlock)    | Moderate (like Cleric)       |
| Flexibility   | Broad, inventive           | Focused, thematic            |

Together they form the **engine of Aetheric balance**:  
the thinker who rewrites the world, and the believer who keeps it from tearing apart.
