### Playing an Etherborne

Etherborne species are anthropomorphic descendants of the great beasts that survived the **Aether
Collapse** — when the psionic storms reshaped biology and machine alike.  
Each race reflects the balance of **instinct and invention**, with unique physical traits and mental
resonance.

Unless stated otherwise, all Etherborne are **Medium** and speak **Common** and one additional
tongue (usually a regional dialect or trade cant).

### 🦎 Aqualoth (Axolotl)

**Amphibious scholars and bio-mechanical engineers of the flooded ruins.**

### 🦌 Tharn (Elk)

**Nomadic guardians of the wild gears — defenders of nature’s mechanical heart.**

### 🪶 Avenar (Avian Etherborne)

**Scholars of the skies — calm, calculating, and eternally curious.**

The Avenar are avian Etherborne descended from the great birds that once nested in the
lattice-towers of the upper cities before the Aether Collapse. When psionic storms raged across the
world, their instincts for flight and mimicry evolved into something greater — the ability to map,
model, and mirror the workings of thought itself.  
Today, the Avenar are Hollowgear’s most cerebral people: archivists, strategists, and engineers of
both idea and invention.

Their society prizes precision and contemplation. To an Avenar, flight is freedom not of body, but
of _mind_ — the ability to soar across knowledge itself.

**Appearance:** Tall, sleek birdfolk with metallic feathers that shimmer from black to silver-blue
under light. Their faces are framed by intricate beak-guards or data-filigree masks, and their
feathers sometimes carry faint circuitry from Aether exposure.  
**Culture:** Matriarchal and consensus-driven, governed by “choirs” — councils of thinkers who
harmonize thought until unity is reached. Their architecture is open, geometric, and impossibly
symmetrical.  
**Personality:** Analytical, quiet, and courteous, but prone to arrogance when challenged
intellectually.

- **Speed:** 30 ft, fly 25 ft _(you cannot fly while wearing medium or heavy armor)_

  the last week.
- **Resonant Logic:** Once per short rest, when you fail an Intelligence or Wisdom check, you may
  reroll it. You must use the new result.
- **Mimetic Insight:** As a bonus action, you can analyze a creature or device within 30 ft. You
  learn one of the following (your choice): its AC, HP range (low/medium/high), or whether it has
  psionic capacity.
- **Featherlight Descent:** You can fall up to 60 feet without taking damage, and you always land on
  your feet.
- **Languages:** Common, Avenari (a whistling, tonal language), and one of your choice (often an
  academic dialect).
