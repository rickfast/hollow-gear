### The World of Hollowgear

In the twilight of the old age, when the gods fell silent and the oceans began to swallow their own
horizons, mortals found salvation not in faith — but in **invention**.

Brass and bone, flesh and filament: life remade itself through **Steamcraft**, and through it came
**Aether**, the invisible pulse between matter and thought. The beasts of the wild — clever, driven,
and desperate — rose from instinct into **sentience**, reshaping themselves into the new inheritors
of the dying world.

They are the **Etherborne**, though few use the name with pride. To most, they are just _folk of the
Hollowgear_ — each race a living experiment in survival, bound together by smoke, steam, and the
haunting hum of psionic machinery.

### The Hollowgear Itself

The Hollowgear is not merely a world — it is a wound.

Once a planet of natural harmony, it now groans beneath layers of broken engines, endless factories,
and decaying megastructures left behind by the vanished **Architects** — beings said to have built
the first minds from living metal. The continents are pocked with relic cities powered by forgotten
cores, their skies crossed by dirigibles, automatons, and drifting psychic storms known as _Aether
tempests_.

Every cog turns at a cost.

Steam runs on Aether; Aether runs on thought. Each invention burns a spark of sentience from the
living world — a cycle of brilliance and decay that no one dares to stop.

### Steam, Aether, and the Soul

In the Hollowgear, **Steam** is more than heat and pressure — it is the visible breath of will.
**Aether** is the invisible thread connecting thought to reality. Together they form the dual
heartbeat of existence: the physical and the psionic, invention and instinct.

Aether can be refined into **Aether Dust** — volatile psychic residue harvested from relics, storms,
and the dying minds of great beasts. It fuels psionic power and advanced machinery alike, giving
rise to a new art: **Mindcraft**.

Those who harness it — the **Mindweavers**, **Templars**, and **Artifex** — stand on the brink of
evolution or annihilation, each one a living experiment in conscious design.

### The Ethos of the Gear

Every invention hums with a kind of prayer.  
Every mind burns with a kind of machine.

This world is defined by **resonance** — the alignment (or discord) between living will and
mechanical intent. The great question is no longer _what is real_, but _what is chosen_.

To live in the Hollowgear is to balance:

- **Instinct** and **Invention**
- **Soul** and **Steam**
- **Creation** and **Consumption**

Those who succeed reshape the world.  
Those who fail are consumed by it — their thoughts echoing forever in the ticking heart of the
Hollowgear.

### Themes of Play

- **Industrial Ascension:** Players inhabit a world where technology is faith and progress is
  sacred.
- **Psionic Identity:** Each mind is a forge; emotion shapes reality.
- **Animal Evolution:** Anthropomorphic species reflect primal instinct filtered through intellect
  and innovation.
- **Entropy and Rebirth:** Every machine breaks. Every soul rebuilds.

Hollowgear invites players to explore not only _what they can build_, but _what they are willing to
sacrifice_ to keep it turning.

### The Role of Adventurers

Adventurers in Hollowgear are tinkerers, seekers, and survivors. They walk the blurred line between
machine and myth — explorers of forgotten ruins, scavengers of divine debris, and sometimes
unwilling catalysts for evolution itself.

They don’t just carry weapons; they carry **ideologies**. Each party becomes a microcosm of the
world — its ambition, faith, corruption, and brilliance reflected in miniature.

The Hollowgear turns — and they turn with it.

### Tone and Style

- **Visual Aesthetic:** Rusted elegance — brass, crystal, and bone.
- **Tone:** Melancholic wonder; awe laced with decay.
- **Gameplay Mood:** Heroic discovery tempered by grim consequence.
- **Inspirations:** Fullmetal Alchemist, Dishonored, Nausicaä, Numenera, Eberron, and Mignola’s
  steampunk gothic.
