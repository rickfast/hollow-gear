### ‚öôÔ∏è The Modding Philosophy

Every weapon and piece of armor in Hollowgear can be **modified** ‚Äî enhanced, customized, and overclocked with gears, crystals, runes, and a little courage.  
Modding is more than engineering ‚Äî it‚Äôs expression. Each mod carries a fragment of its maker‚Äôs intent, a whisper of will made mechanical.

### üî© Mod Slots & Limitations

Each item (weapon, armor, or shield) can hold a limited number of **Mod Slots** depending on its craftsmanship tier.

| Craft Tier   | Mod Slots | Notes                                                |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Workshop (I) | 1         | Common gear; can hold a single minor mod.            |
| Guild (II)   | 2         | Stable for most advanced modifications.              |
| Relic (III)  | 3         | Rare psionic conductors and alloys.                  |
| Mythic (IV)  | 4         | Sentient or Aether-reactive; limited only by sanity. |

**Installing a Mod:**

-   Requires **Tinker‚Äôs Tools**, 1 hour, and a DC 12 + Mod Tier **Intelligence (Tinkering)** check.
-   Failing by 5+ causes **Malfunction** (see below).
-   Removing a mod safely requires half the installation time.

### üîß Mod Crafting & Cost

| Mod Tier       | Craft DC | Time   | Cost (Cogs) | Power Level                  |
| -------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| I ‚Äì Common     | 10       | 2 hrs  | 25          | Basic (minor stat boost)     |

| III ‚Äì Relic    | 16       | 8 hrs  | 200         | Multi-effect or psionic mods |
| IV ‚Äì Prototype | 18       | 16 hrs | 400+        | Sentient or unstable         |

To craft a Mod, you must know its **blueprint** or disassemble an existing one.  
Artifex characters can attempt to improvise a blueprint using a **DC 15 Arcana or Investigation** check after examining similar mods.
